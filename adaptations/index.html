                        The main reason why I started writing plays was so that I would have access to plays that my students could stage without having to go through the arduous process of requesting for copyright or paying for royalties. I completely respect the need to protect one's work, but it is difficult when working on a tight budget and also taking into account the need to appeal to a more modern audience, since plays that are no longer contained by copyright are older. So, if you like my plays, I would love for you to stage it. You just need to send in a request and I will email it you. Also, if you have written plays that you think would be suitable for students to stage, I would love to read it and give my students a chance to perform it. Theatre is a medium that benefits from sharing, so let's share and benefit together :)

        		    Natasha is an English Literature major from Nanyang Technological University. She is currently an English Literature teacher in a school in Singapore. She has loved writing all her life, but only discovered her love for plays when she became the teacher-in-charge of the school's drama club. 
					Since then, the drama club has staged three of her plays, <i>Blueprints</i>, <i>That's not the Point</i> and <i>Carbon Copy</i> (sequel to <i>Blueprints</i>). 
					The club's performance of <i>Carbon Copy</i> won the Certificate of Accomplishment (silver award) at the Singapore Youth Festival in 2016. She hopes to inspire her students to love Literature and Theatre just as much as she does.
